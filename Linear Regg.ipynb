    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.\n",
    "2. Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.\n",
    "3. Independence: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "4. Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed."
